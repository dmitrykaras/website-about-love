## 🌹  About the Project

This website is more than just code — it’s a story.
A story about how sometimes, moments we create together matter more than words.
Let it be a reminder of the meetings, the waiting at the metro, and the little joys.

> This website is a personal gift, created with warmth, care, and love.
> It reflects the moments that matter to us, designed to be remembered forever.
